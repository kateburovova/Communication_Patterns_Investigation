# Communication Patterns Investigation

## About the project
This the final project for the Computational Social Science course 2022, for Masters in Data Science at UCU 21-23.
It contains the exploration of personal communication patterns based on analysis of all dialog data from Telegram.
The flow of exploration is guided by the assignments. 
It consists of 2 parts - first attempts (under the headline Homework 5) and improved final results (under the headline Homework 6).
The collection of dataset with personal communication was obtained with the help of repository [https://github.com/SanGreel/telegram-data-collection](https://github.com/SanGreel/telegram-data-collection).
This project might serve as an inspiration into chat data exploration, though structure and focus is heavily influenced by the personal experience.
